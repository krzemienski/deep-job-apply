# Deep Job Apply – Comprehensive Project Prompt

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Project Overview
The **Deep Job Apply** application is a sophisticated automation system designed to streamline the job application process by leveraging browser automation and artificial intelligence. This application enables users to upload their résumé (in PDF format) and supply a list of job URLs. The system then autonomously navigates to each URL, detects relevant application elements (such as “Apply” buttons or form fields), and submits applications based on the résumé details and additional context. This document outlines a detailed project prompt, covering architecture, technology choices, data models, user and system flows, containerization, deployment strategies, and extensibility considerations.

### 1.2. Project Objectives
- **Automate Job Applications:** Minimize manual effort by automating repetitive tasks.
- **Utilize AI for Intelligent Interaction:** Leverage AI to analyze page content and dynamically interact with forms.
- **Provide Real-Time Status Tracking:** Offer a dashboard to monitor application statuses and detailed logs.
- **Ensure Scalability & Flexibility:** Design a system that is easily extendable for new job boards and automation strategies.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Maintain high security standards for handling personal résumé data and application logs.
